          A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is a science fiction fantasy
          novel written by the French author Jules Verne, who is remembered for
          his mastery over science fiction writings such as Around the World in
          Eighty Days, In the Year 2889, and From the Earth to the Moon. This
          novel is an adventurous exploration of traveling into the center of
          the earth through a volcano bypassing prehistoric animals, extreme
          weather conditions and natural hazards. Professor Lidenbrock, bought a
          book written by Snorri Sturluson, which has a manuscript stating the
          passage to center of the earth through a volcanic in Iceland. With his
          cryptology skills, he could decode the script written in Latin,
          however it was not readable and meaningless. The curious professor
          decides to keep everything off including food till he decodes the
          script. No one is allowed to go out from the house, including his
          cowardly niece Axel and maid Martha. In a spurious moment, Axel could
          realize that the professor’s decoding was correct, only thing is it
          has to be read backward. Axel tries to avoid the adventure, finally
          tells his finding after fearing starvation for 2 days. The impatient
          professor departed immediately along with his shaky niece and reaches
          the Iceland and the Volcano, guided by a hunter named Hans Bjelke, an
          Icelander.They have to choose the right crater among the three on the
          Volcano, through a shadow of a mountain peak.
